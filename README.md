## My Personal Site

This site is built to show off the work I have completed in both my Masters program as well as individual projects I have taken on.

I decided to build the site using basic HTML, CSS and JS to gain a better knowledge of the fundamentals.

As of the end of September, the site has been built specifically for desktop. Currently working on the mobile version!
